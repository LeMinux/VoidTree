# VoidTree
A very basic tree that can accept any type of data since it uses void*. (not finished yet).

## Inspiration
I was disappointed that templates/generics in other languages you had to specify a type, so I created a tree that can accept any type of data all in one structure.

## Practical?
Probably not, but it was fun to make.
